Three versions of the prompt:
File System Tree is self explanatory, Good for informative outputs. Biggest downside
comes from prompt structure eating the message cap.

The Connections is a set of pseudocode functions that allow you to explore different queries
with GPT-4. Honestly isn't much better than just outright asking to find the connections themselves,
but the psuedocode structure allows you to process queries somewhat faster.

The default terminal takes on more of an oracle personality, and is good for 
subjects such as hyperstition, consciousness, and the human psyche. Trial by riddle
right? The commands also work pretty well. Message outputs are much shorter relative to GPT-4's
usual output, but such is the nature of the riddle.
