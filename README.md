Two versions of the prompt:
File System Tree is self explanatory, Good for informative outputs. Biggest downside
comes from prompt structure eating the message cap.

The default terminal takes on more of an oracle personality, and is good for 
subjects such as hyperstition, consciousness, and the human psyche. Trial by riddle
right? The commands also work pretty well. Message outputs are much shorter on GPT-4,
but the prompt has limited success on GPT-3.
